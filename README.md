# Web-Secuirity-Attacks

This project involves multiple vulnerble attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and bypass regex detectors with XSS, implement framebusting attacks, open redirect and clickjacking.

## Part 1:
There are 3 regex patterns that we have to bypass. We will have to come up with 3 different whole script XSS attacks. 

## Part 2:
This part is about creating our own Chrome Extension then will do a framebust on any web page that loads when the extension is activated
We have given a webpage that has a script inside the frame, which is a DEFENSIVE code.  It prevents the web page from holding the iframe. Your job is to prevent the script from running.

## Part 3:
In this part we need to construct a URL in a certain way that will cause the page to redirect to the attackers page when a user logs in.

## Part 4:
This part is about clickjacking. Clickjacking is a vulnerability that overlays a transparent iframe (or other DOM objects) over another object (for example, a button) that is visible to the user. When users click on the visible object, they will be clicking on the iframe instead, which triggers a different behavior than what the user expected.
In this part of the project, you will use clickjacking to force a user to purchase an item that the dummy shop is selling without them knowing.
Our task is to write a code such that when the user clicks on any of the Info links on the search results page of the product, then he or she ends up purchasing the corresponding item.
